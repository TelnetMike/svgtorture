	<title>One dimension fill</title>
	<desc>
		Test filling in one dimension shapes: "line" elements, as well as specific "polyline" and "path",
		which although counter-intuitive, is performed in at least one implementation.
		
		Specifically regarding the line:
			"Because 'line' elements are single lines and thus are geometrically one-dimensional,
			they have no interior; thus, 'line' elements are never filled [...]" [1]
		Nevertheless, ASV ignores this and "fills" the line by creating an additional,
		very thin stroke below the actual stroke. Even when stroke is defined it becomes visible:
		for example in dashed array lines, where the gaps show the symptom, as well as in very thin
		lines and/or zoomed out images (where the anti-aliasing kicks off and the line "fill" color
		blends with the line stroke color).
		
		ASV can be worked around by setting the "fill" attribute to "none" in these shapes. Note that
		if "fill" isn't specified, ASV assumes the default value which is "black" [2].
		
		Pass criteria:
			- No red should be visible.
		
		Passes:
			- Mozilla Firefox (3.6.6);
			- Google Chrome (6.0.466.000);
			- Apache Batik (1.8pre);
			- Internet Explorer (platform preview 1.9.7874.6000).
		
		Fails:
			- Adobe SVG Viewer (3.03, 6.0beta).
