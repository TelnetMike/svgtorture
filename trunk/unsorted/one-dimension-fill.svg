	<title>One dimension fill</title>
	<desc>
		Test filling in one dimension shapes ("line" elements as well as particular cases of
		"polyline", "path", "rect", etc.), which although counter-intuitive, is performed in
		at least one implementation.
		
		Specifically regarding the line:
			"Because 'line' elements are single lines and thus are geometrically one-dimensional,
			they have no interior; thus, 'line' elements are never filled [...]" [1]
		Nevertheless, ASV ignores this and "fills" the line by creating an additional,
		very thin stroke below the actual stroke. Even when stroke is defined it becomes visible:
		for example in dashed array lines, where the gaps show the symptom, as well as in very thin
		lines and/or scaled down/zoomed out images, where the anti-aliasing kicks off and the line
		"fill" color blends with the line stroke color.
		
		ASV can be worked around by setting the "fill" attribute to "none" in these shapes. Note that
		if "fill" isn't specified, ASV assumes the default value which is "black" [2]. Another possible
		workaround, for the anti-aliasing side effect only, is to set the "shape-rendering" property [3]
		to "crispEdges", which basically disables anti-aliasing and can be easily simulated by toggling
		the "Higher quality" setting found in the context menu.
		
		This seems to be a long known issue (highly related thread [4] dating from 2002).
		
		Pass criteria:
			- No red should be visible.
		
		Passes:
			- Mozilla Firefox (3.6.6);
			- Google Chrome (6.0.466.000);
			- Apache Batik (1.8pre);
			- Internet Explorer (platform preview 1.9.7874.6000).
		
		Fails:
			- Adobe SVG Viewer (3.03, 6.0beta).
