This directory will be used to house tests that have not been sorted yet.  Check in all files
here initially.  As we categorize/incorporate tests into the overall Torture Test, we will move
files out of here.

Tests do not need to have any particular format, but it would be good to put a short paragraph
in the test (in a <desc> element?) describing pass/fail criteria and possibly what is being tested.
